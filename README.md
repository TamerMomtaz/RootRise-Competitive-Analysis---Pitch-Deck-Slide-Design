# RootRise-Competitive-Analysis---Pitch-Deck-Slide-Design
 comprehensive merged competitive analysis document that consolidates all the research findings from the various documents, as well as a detailed pitch deck slide design recommendation.
The Pitch Deck Competitive Slide Design
The second document I've created translates this analysis into actionable slide designs for your pitch deck. Rather than overwhelming investors with a list of competitors, the visual framework I've designed tells a story about market whitespace.
The main competitive slide uses a four-quadrant map that immediately shows why RootRise is unique. The axes represent "Embedded Human Support" versus "Technology Only" on one dimension, and "No Capital Access" versus "Capital Access" on the other. When investors see this visual, they'll immediately understand that while other players excel in one dimension, only RootRise combines all the critical elements needed for true SME transformation.
